![Textylic: the notes app for the 22nd century](https://github.com/akhilesh-balaji/Textylic/blob/master/res/images/mockups/Mockup.png?raw=true)

This is **Textylic**â€”the notes app for the 22nd century. It supports various formatting options including **bold**, *italic*, <ins>underline</ins>, `code`, and ~~strikethrough~~. The app also supports other formats such as bullet points, and hyperlinks. You can also open links in your browser! You can customize the app by changing the theme, too! Unlike the native windows sticky notes app, this app stays on your desktop like a windows 7 widget, without the need to install any large and cumbersome software such as Rainmeter. This means that it won't interfere with your work by creating icons on the taskbar that you need to click on to open. Textylic also supports  multiple note windows, and scrolling. So, you are not limited to the default square window size.

<!-- As of now, there are a few bugs. Here are a couple of the known bugs that I am working on fixing:

## Features

- **Windows 7-esque desktop widget**: Remember those useful desktop widgets in windows 7? These were interactive features in the desktop that didn't interfere with your work by showing up in the taskbar. Instead, they stayed on the desktop, and if you minimized all the maximized windows, you could interact with them These were removed in Windows 10. But, this app mimics their behaviour, and has a modern notes window that stays on the desktop. This has a lot of features extended from the default windows 10 sticky notes app, and some completely new ones, too!

- **New Window**: Textylic has the ability to create multiples notes windows on the same desktop. This is a particularly useful feature when taking notes during meetings or class. They can also be organized by use of other features in the app such as colour coding. These individual notes windows don't interfere with each other in any way, and you can even edit the same note in two different windows at the same time!
This can be accessed by clicking the plus icon in the top toolbar.

- **Text formatting Options**: Plaintext, at times, gets too boring, and it's hard to emphasize text. When a notes app doesn't support these, it means that you have to rely on online text to Unicode formatting convertors. But fear not, for Textylic supports over 7 types of text formatting, with more coming soon!

- **Colour Themes**: Using colour themes, you can both customize the appearance of Textylic, and organize yourself by colour coding the notes. There are 4 colour options available as of now. This feature can also be combined with other features, such as naming and renaming your notes, to better organize your note-taking experience. After all, nothing's better than a splash of colour on your desktop!

- **Links**: You can link piece of text by selecting it, and using <kbd>Ctrl + O</kbd> on the keyboard, or using the formatting toolbar icon. To open the link, select the link, and use <kbd>Ctrl + O</kbd>, or the "Open selected link" option in the top toolbar.

- **Automatic Saving**: This is quite a handy tool if your computer suddenly crashed, and you have unsaved work. You only need to save a note once, to choose its location and name. Then, Textylic will automatically save it every half a second or so. It also saves you the trouble of hitting Ctrl + S every time you made a change, and wearing those keys down to the plastic underneath.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **<kbd>Ctrl + Z</kbd>**: Undo
- **<kbd>Ctrl + Y</kbd>**: Redo
- **<kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd>**: Add a hyperlink to a selected object
