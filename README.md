This is Textylic: The perfect note-taking app. It supports various formatting options including bold, italic, underline, code style, and strikethrough. The app also supports other formats such as bullet points, and linking. You can also open links in your browser! You can customize the app by changing the theme, too! Unlike the native windows sticky notes app, this app stays on your desktop like a windows 7 widget, without the need to install any third-party software such as rainmeter. This means that it won't interfere with your work by creating icons on the taskbar that you need to click on to open. Textylic also supports  multiple note windows, and scrolling. So, you are not limited to the default square window size.

To access the notes window, simply open the .exe file. You can save this to your desktop, or pin it to the start menu for easy access (installer coming soon!). You can continue doing your work, and the notes window will not appear on the taskbar. To get it back, smimply minimize all windows, or use Win+D, like those windows 7 desktop widgets. 

In the future, you can expect to see features such as improved font rendering and saving the formatting as well. Also, I am working on applying the formatting options first, and continue typing in the same style.

<!-- As of now, there are a few bugs. Here are a couple of the known bugs that I am working on fixing:

## Features

### Windows 7-esque desktop widget
Remember those useful desktop widgets win windows 7? These were interactive features in the desktop that didn't interfere with your work by showing up in the taskbar. Instead, they stayed on the desktop, and if you minimized all the maximised windows, you could interact with them These were removed in Windows 10. But, this app mimicks their behaviour, and has a modern, fluent design style notes window that stays on the desktop. This has a lot of features extended from the default windows 10 sticky notes app, and some completely new ones, too!

### Undo/Redo
These are the single integral features of any text editor. They can be accessed by clicking the extended menu and using the "Undo" and "Redo" options over there, or using "Ctrl + z" to undo, and "Ctrl + y" to redo.

### New Window
This can be accessed by clicking the plus icon in the top toolbar, or using "Ctrl + n"

### Text formatting Options
These can be found in the bottom toolbar. As of now, you have to select some text and apply the formatting options. I am still working on the option to apply it, and continue typing in the same style.

### Saving and opening notes
You can access these in the extended menu. You can save a note with the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + s"

### Links
You can link piece of text by selecting it, and using "Ctrl + k" on the keyboard, or using the formatting toolbar icon. To open the link, select the link, and use "Ctrl + o", or the "Open selected link" option in the top toolbar.

### Automatic Saving
All you need to do is to save the dcuments once, for the first time, when you name it. After this, you don't need to worry about saving because of Auto saving!

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl + z**: Undo
- **Ctlk + y**: Redo
- **Ctrl + k**: Add a hyperlink to a selected object
- **Ctrl + o**: Open the selected hyperlink in default webbrowser
- **Ctrl + b**: Make selected text bold
- **Ctrl + i**: Make selected text italic
