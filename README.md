This is Textylic: The perfect note-taking app. It supports various formatting options including bold, italic, underline, code style, and strikethrough. The app also supports other formats such as bullet points, and linking. You can also open links in your browser! You can customize the app by changing the theme, too! Unlike the native windows sticky notes app, this app stays on your desktop like a windows 7 widget, without the need to install any third-party software such as rainmeter. This means that it won't interfere with your work by creating icons on the taskbar that you need to click on to open. Textylic also supports  multiple note windows, and scrolling. So, you are not limited to the default square window size.

In the future, you can expect to see features such as improved font rendering and saving the formatting as well. Also, I am working on applying the formatting options first, and continue typing in the same style.

As of now, there are a few bugs. Here are a couple of the known bugs that I am working on fixing:
Notes Window dissapears when you do Win + D, and only appears when action center or start menu are opened

Here are the various features in Textylic, and how to use them:

Undo/Redo: These are the single integral features of any text editor. They can be accessed by clicking the extended menu and using the "Undo" and "Redo" options over there, or using "Ctrl + z" to undo, and "Ctrl + y" to redo.

New Window: This can be accessed by clicking the plus icon in the top toolbar, or using "Ctrl + n"

Text formatting options: These can be found in the bottom toolbar. As of now, you have to select some text and apply the formatting options. I am still working on the option to apply it, and continue typing in the same style.

Save Note, Open Note: You can access these in the extended menu. You can save a note with the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + s"

Links: You can link piece of text by selecting it, and using "Ctrl + k" on the keyboard. To open the link, select the link, and use "Ctrl + o", or the "Open selected link" option in the top toolbar.
